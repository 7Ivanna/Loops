# Welcome To My Thesis Work!
(to the tune of welcome to the internet by bo burnham)

Welcome to my thesis work! 

have a loop around

any kind of even mesh you can think of is inbound

weve got two loops of optic

one big and one small

if you wanted an odd mesh youd be the first

Welcome to my thesis work!

come into the loop

would you like to make a cnot gate or any other logic gate?

theres no need to panic 

the thesis is done

just give me your inputs and well do the rest 

Welcome to my thesis work!

what would you prefer?

would you like to find the time-bin count or fibre cable length?

be happy

be loopy 

be full of time bins

youve got a million even meshes to make
